## Prompt Template
A prompt template in LangChain is a reusable structure designed to generate prompts for language models. It works by defining a string template containing placeholders for dynamic values. When specific inputs are provided, these placeholders are filled in to produce a final prompt tailored for the model. This approach allows for consistent, reproducible, and flexible prompt generation across various use cases
